Target exercises are very important to dieters trying to become toned and firm. People frequently want to know how get a smaller stomach or how to get a bigger butt. They often want to reduce one area without losing what they have in another area. Technically, spot reducing isn't possible. 

When you lose weight, you'll lose it in a genetically pre-determined pattern. I am of the belief though, that the areas we give the most attention to in our workouts, benefit the most. Therefore, these target exercises should make it easier for you to sculpt the body of your dreams! Below you will find links to various web pages that offer good, effective exercises that can be performed at home with little or no equipment. Activities that use the large leg muscles burn the most calories. Power walking, jogging, biking, skating, swimming laps, jumping rope, racquetball, dancing, and jumping jacks all tone the lower body quite effectively.

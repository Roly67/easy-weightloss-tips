Enjoy these free Mediterranean diet recipes and experience satisfaction on every level! The Mediterranean diet is rapidly becoming the most popular diet on the planet! In this case, the word "diet" refers not only to weight loss, but a style of eating that has proven to reduce the risk of cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease! The focus of your eating will center around an abundance of fruits and vegetables, olives, nuts, extra virgin olive oil, lean protein, especially fish, low-fat dairy, and whole grains in the form of bread, pasta, brown rice, etc.

The following free Mediterranean diet recipes come from a variety of sources. Friends shared some with me; some came from [Mediterranean diet cookbooks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-28-mediterranean-diet-books %}) or other sources. If I know the source, I'll give credit. They're all easy so don't be afraid to try them.  If I can do this, you can too! In most cases, you won't have nutritional information, but the Mediterranean diet isn't about counting calories, fats, etc. It's about eating and enjoying certain nutrient-rich foods and selected fats, until satisfied.

If losing weight is your goal, as always, you must pay attention to portion sizes and not overeat. If you don't spend much time in the kitchen cooking and you're not sure how to get started, see my [meal ideas for the Mediterranean diet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-20-meal-ideas-for-mediterranean-diet %}).

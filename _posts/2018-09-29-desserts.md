## Healthy Desserts For Weight Loss!
![Healthy desserts can be good](/assets/images/healthy-desserts.jpg){:style="width:335px;height:278px;float:right;margin:0 0 8px 8px;"}
Healthy desserts are my favorite part of dieting! No matter how much you try, you'll struggle to give up desserts for very long. But the reality is, you don't have to! In fact, it's been proven that completely cutting desserts from your diet actually has a negative effect on long term weight loss, meaning fewer people actually stick to it. So instead, educate yourself about low calorie and healthy desserts and then carefully moderate your dessert eating. That way, you'll be able to reward yourself without ruining all your hard work!

Here's a neat little trick from 'Weight Watchers' so that you really can have your cake and eat it too! You can't imagine how delicious this cake is until you try it! Mix one can of diet soda with one box of cake mix. If you use a dark cake mix, use a dark soda. If you use a light cake mix, use a light-colored soda, such as 7-Up or Sprite. Those are the only two ingredients - the box of mix (no eggs, oil, water, etc.) and the soda. Then simply bake according to the package directions and enjoy the results! 

## Let There Be Cake!
Another popular Weight Watchers trick is to use a cake mix with a canned fruit or vegetable. Try a box of Angel Food Cake mix and one 20oz.can-crushed pineapple, undrained. Yep! Those are the only two ingredients. Bake according to package directions. My friend, Pat, likes to pour a can of cherry pie filling over the top before serving. Try a box of chocolate cake mix with a can of pumpkin. Add a little bit of water if the batter is too thick. Bake and enjoy!

An important component of any diet is cardio exercise for weight loss.  

“Cardio,” short for cardiovascular, is a term used to encompass aerobic training, which increases the function of the heart, lungs, and circulatory system.

This would include activities such as [biking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-14-exercise-bike-for-weight-loss %}), jogging, [power walking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-20-walking-for-weight-loss %}), [swimming laps]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-09-aquatic-exercise-for-weight-loss %}), stair climbing, jumping rope, and dancing.

To keep it simple, "aerobic" means with oxygen, so activities that require a great deal of oxygen are considered aerobic. As long as you are breathing regularly, your workout is aerobic. You've probably heard of the term "anaerobic." Anaerobic means without oxygen, so when you are gasping for breath, your workout turned anaerobic.

Cardiovascular activity is an excellent way to [burn maximum calories]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-12-burn-maximum-calories %}) and trim fat. 

It is even possible to [raise your resting metabolism]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-11-basal-metabolic-rate %}) if these activities are performed on a regular basis and at an intensity level that is challenging.  

Of course the great benefit of a [higher functioning metabolism]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-30-foods-that-speed-metabolism %}) is that it will be easier to maintain weight.

Another advantage of an intense workout is that it can affect hormonal levels by releasing endorphins, which help combat feelings of depression and fatigue. Many people experience what is often referred to as a “runner’s high!” I've never personally experienced such a thing, but I do get a different kind of "high" when I work out intensely. It's the high from knowing that I did something good for myself, and knowing that I am done for the day!

Speaking of "cardio exercise for weight loss" and  "intense workout", have you ever considered training for a [triathlon for weight loss](http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/cms/article-detail.asp?articleid=2360){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} motivation? There are many different levels of triathlons, so find one a little above your level of fitness and challenge yourself!

<div class="CalloutBox"><h3>Working out on an empty stomach?</h3>
<h4>A 2011 report published in <em>Strength and Conditioning Journal</em>&nbsp;reports that the body burns approximately the same amount of fat regardless of whether you eat before or after a workout. The report goes on to state, however, that without proper fuel for the workout, your body may lose muscle, and your calorie-burn will be diminished. This study directly contradicts the myth that exercising on an empty stomach burns more fat.<br><br></h4>

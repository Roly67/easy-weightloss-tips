## Voted "Best Answer" by Yahoo! Answers

I'm telling you, this works!

1. Go on the [5-4-3-2-1 diet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-31-5-4-3-2-1diet %}) it works really well, but choose healthy foods to eat (lean protein, veggies, fruits, whole-grains, low-fat dairy, heart-healthy oils). You don't want your metabolism to get sluggish because that slows weight loss. 
2. Give up all sweet drinks (even diet soda) and drink mostly water
3. Give up all extra sodium (don't salt your food and don't eat salty food)
4. Give up sugar (this is easy after the first three days)
5. Be active 30-60 minutes a day (the more the better for your metabolism and for burning calories)

Good luck!

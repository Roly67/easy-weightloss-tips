## Choose a weight loss eating plan:

[The Pilot's Diet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-01-the-pilots-diet %}){:style="display:block;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;"}
This 28-day diet relies on food combinations instead of calories for its success. Heavy on protein but light on carbs and sugar, this diet delivers the goods!  It's the quickest belly-fat buster I've ever experienced!

[The New 5-4-3-2-1 Diet Plan (Drastic Diet #1)](#){:style="display:block;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;"}
I designed this plan after watching my friend, Lisa, eat on a trip to Jamaica. She had recently undergone gastric bypass surgery and could only eat small amounts of food at a time. At some point during out vacation, it occurred to me that I could eat that way too! 

[Drastic Diet #2](#){:style="display:block;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;"}
I created this diet when I needed to experience rapid weight loss but didn’t want to sacrifice my health. Each menu item is highly nutritious but the minimal food intake takes the weight off fast!

[Drastic Diet #3](#){:style="display:block;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;"}
I did not create this particular diet but I did go on it with my office-mates at work. Again, the food is nutritious but minimal. You WILL lose weight!

[No Flour/No Sugar Diet](#){:style="display:block;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;"}
Dr. Gott created this diet. He has books available if you want more information. It’s an easy diet to follow. I have a friend who is never more than 7-10 pounds overweight and she swears this is the only diet that works for her! 

[Three-Day Protein Diet](#){:style="display:block;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;"}
I don’t know who created this diet but it’s severe which is why it’s designed for three days. The food is good though, so it’s easy to stay on for that amount of time.

[Cleansing and Detox Diets](#){:style="display:block;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;"}
These diets are the craze now and I have no personal experience with them. They seem very similar to what we used to call "fasting". I have "fasted" many times and I consider it a rather severe way to achieve rapid weight loss. Information is provided here if you want to know more…

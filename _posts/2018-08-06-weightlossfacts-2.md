Know your weight loss facts--__not all fat is created equal__!

Recent reports indicate that fat accumulated around the waist and chest is more dangerous to your health than fat accumulated in other areas of the body!

The National Institute of Health reports that a waist size larger than __40 inches (males) and 35 inches (females)__ increases the chances of developing heart disease and cancer.

Research is now telling us that people who accumulate fat around their mid-sections are more likely to develop age-related dementia than those who accumulate fat in other parts of the body. This report comes with a bit of hope attached to it. Doctors say it is never too late to lose weight and get fit!

## Waist to Hip Ratio:
Your waist to hip ratio may be the best test for predicting a heart attack! Measure your waist at the smallest point and measure your hips at the widest point.

Divide the first number by the second number.

__An ideal ratio is 0.8 or lower!__

Note: One of the best "belly-busting" diets I've come across recently is The Pilot's Diet. This 28-day plan is strict and must be followed to the letter, but the results are amazing! While you are at it, check out our easy tips to help you reduce belly fat!

## Food Pyramid
This food pyramid, published by the Harvard School of Public Health, is informative and easy to understand. It has slight differences from the one published by the USDA.

The knowledge provided by the Food Pyramid may be the most important information that we have. ChooseMyPlate.gov provides volumes of information about the way that we SHOULD be eating for long-term health and fitness.

The site is updated as needed and offers it's own diet plan and a method for tracking. It is easy to see at a glance that our diets should consist mainly of grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and protein.

Healthy recipes are easy to find online that can help you and your family achieve your wellness goals!

Make it a priority to learn to eat healthy! These simple weight loss facts can make all the difference!

## June 2011, Recommendations!
Important changes were revealed about the nutritional guidelines we should be following for optimal health! The government is moving away from the pyramid concept and trying to find something that is easier to use. Their new initiative is called My Plate.

You can read more at ChooseMyPlate.gov - they certainly are trying to make it easier for us to make wiser and healthier choices! Way to go!!

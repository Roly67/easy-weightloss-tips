Here are a few more diets that can help you reach your weight loss goals!  

Sometimes just the act of trying something new--a plan that you've never tried before--will give you that added boost of motivation that you need to stick to your program.  

Many people find success by frequently switching diets. This provides the advantage of never getting bored and it keeps your metabolism "on its toes" and wondering what's coming next. 

There's nothing wrong with doing this, as long as you make sure that the diets you choose provide nutrient-rich foods. No amount of weight loss is worth your health! 

We offer many more diets for you to choose from...

### No Flour / No Sugar Diet

I first heard of this diet from my very fit friend, Marian, who swears it is the only way she can take off any weight. You know those "small" people have a tougher time losing than the rest of us. 

As far as I know, Dr. Peter Gott, who writes a syndicated, health-related column that runs in my local newspaper, devised this diet. It’s as simple as it sounds.

Eliminate sugar and flour from the diet. That includes all flour, even whole wheat. You can pretty much eat anything else you want within reason, keeping in mind that calories count. I’ve even tried a version of this with my Weight Watchers plan and had success.

Surprisingly, [giving up sugar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-27-sugar %}) is the easiest part. After a day or two, you really notice the cravings decreasing. I found the elimination of flour to be much more challenging. It’s an easy diet to follow, as there are so few rules.  

You can find out more information about this diet by reading the book, __Dr. Gott’s No Flour, No Sugar Diet__, by Peter H. Gott.

### Three Day Protein

Welcome to more diets!
My friend, Lisa, shared this diet with me recently and it's pretty painless for the three days that it's designed to last. 

For breakfast each morning you eat two eggs, prepared any way you like. For the other two meals of the day, you eat ground beef. That's it...ground beef! There is no limit to the amount that you can eat, but as always, remember that calories count. I purchased LEAN ground beef. I browned it in a skillet and added a little garlic powder and pepper--no salt. Mrs. Dash would be fine since it is sodium-free. If you must eat salt, you can have "lite." No condiments!  You may have half an orange for a mid-afternoon snack.

NOTE:
I've tried this diet again, adding both salt, and using condiments, such as ketchup. I did not achieve the same level of success.

I am always on the lookout for more diets to try. If you have something to share, please [contact me](/contact-us).

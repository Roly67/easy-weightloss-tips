## Apple Cider Vinegar Benefits
[Apple cider vinegar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-10-apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss %}) is vinegar fermented from apple cider.  Apple cider is the unprocessed liquid that is extracted from crushed apples.  Thus, [apple cider vinegar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-10-apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss %}) offers the same vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber contained in apples. 

Apple cider vinegar, when raw and unfiltered, is often used as a digestive tonic to be consumed before or after meals.  It is said to be able to ease digestion, protect colon health and relieve acid reflux. 

Apple cider vinegar has alkaline-forming properties.  This helps our body maintain its proper pH balance for higher energy levels and proper functioning of all body systems.  It also has a high pectin content which helps bring down the “bad” cholesterol in your bloodstream.

When it comes to weight loss, apple cider vinegar’s ability to prevent fat from forming is due to its high levels of acetic acids.  Acetic acids slow down starch digestion and lower blood sugar levels.  With low blood sugar levels, the body is not prompted to produce insulin to convert glucose into fat.

## Raw Honey
[Raw Honey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-13-raw-honey %}), created by bees is a natural sweetener that is full of vitamins, minerals and important amino acids.  Consuming raw honey is a way to get many of the essential nutrients your body needs to function.

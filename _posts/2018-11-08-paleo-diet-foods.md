Paleo diet foods consists mainly of proteins, fruits, and vegetables (a modern version of what our Stone Age ancestors could hunt and gather). The idea behind this very popular diet is that our bodies are biologically programmed to respond favorably to this type of meal plan.

It's believed that the way we eat today (specifically we mean processed foods) is responsible for a range of health issues including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and even heart disease. The Paleo plan addresses this very important health issue and provides an alternative lifestyle, which promotes fantastic health and renewed energy! Paleo diet foods are eaten in their natural state, without processing.

Foods such as fish and shellfish, meat, eggs, nuts, vegetables, roots, fruits, and berries are key to the plan. Beverages are very restricted, with water, organic green tea, and coconut water being most of what's allowed.

Prohibited foods consists of salt, dairy (including milk, cheese, butter, yogurt), grains, starches (breads, rice, corn), sugars (with the exception of the occasional bit of raw honey or coconut palm sugar), potatoes, legumes, and processed oils.

Physical activity is strongly encouraged on this program as our ancestors were very active in their quest to survive. If this Stone Age diet seems too restrictive, there are some modified plans that allow oils such as olive, grape seed, coconut, palm, and sesame. While potatoes, rice and breads are prohibited, you can have sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and plantains.

## What about portion sizes?

Portions are not limited and you are encouraged to eat whenever you are hungry. Naturally, if weight loss is your main goal, then you must be mindful of calories. However, if the diet seems too limited for your lifestyle, try following it for two weeks to determine if you feel better, then opt to follow it several days a week.

One great benefit of this particular weight loss diet which is [high in protein]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-06-high-protein-foods %}) is that hunger is generally satisfied continuously, making it easier to stick to the plan. Try the paleo diet, it's easier than you think!

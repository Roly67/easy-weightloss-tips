Portion control is the single most important factor in healthy eating! For every doctor that supports one medical theory, you'll find a doctor that thinks it's "rubbish." For every weight-loss expert who supports one diet plan, you find another who calls it "ridiculous." With so many diet plans and weight loss options available, how are you supposed to choose? Don't worry, there's good news!   

__The one thing that diet and fitness experts agree on is the importance of portion control!__ While you may choose short-term "drastic" diets to get ready for a special event or to jump-start your weight loss for motivational purposes; without the knowledge, understanding, and practice, you're most likely doomed to find that weight again.

Practicing portion discipline is critical. In the diet tools section of this website, it was recommended that you purchase a __food scale and measuring spoons__ to help you learn proper portion sizes when you are cooking at home. A tablespoon of heart-healthy olive oil, for example, is a very small amount. Having these tools will enable you to weigh and measure your food until you have seen the proper amounts enough to make educated "guess-timations."  

Use the nutrition fact label on products to help you with portion sizes. Read the labels carefully though, because looks can be deceiving!

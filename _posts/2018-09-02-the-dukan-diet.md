The Dukan Diet first came on my radar as I watched my friend, Gigi, become "the incredible shrinking woman" right before my eyes.

She and I have both struggled with weight issues for years, and while she told me about a new diet she was trying, I really didn't pay that much attention at first.

We used to work together and see each other daily, but now manage to get together only on weekends. Because I only saw her once a week at the most, Gigi's weight loss was very noticeable each time!

It didn't take long before I was educating myself about this very French diet!

The Dukan Diet, first published in France in 2000, was created by Dr. Pierre Dukan, a French neurologist, who now has over 35 years experience in clinical nutrition.

The diet consists of 4 phases that, if followed exactly, will take the individual through weight loss to maintenance for life.

Dr. Dukan believes (and I have to agree) that a successful weight loss program must have 4 elements:

* Specific instructions which are non-negotiable (rules)
* Rapid and substantial weight loss in the beginning to kick in motivation (a must!)
* "Low frustration" (easy to follow)
* Be "comprehensive" (commit to the full program or don't bother)

I read The Dukan Diet book and found it very interesting. In a nutshell, the diet is [high-protein]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-06-high-protein-foods %}), low-sugar, and low-carb. Dr. Dukan goes into detail why this type of diet is so successful, why we need protein, and why protein diets work so well.

If you are considering this diet, you are definitely going to want to read the book. I read a lot of diet books and this one was a "keeper." While I'm sharing the high points of the diet, there are other important elements that you must learn from the book. In order to be successful, it is essential to follow the "rules."

As I mentioned before, the diet consists of 4 phases:

### Phase One: The Attack phase
During this phase, designed to last 2-7 days, you eat only pure proteins from a very extensive list. Weight loss is rapid and motivational. Pure proteins consist of things like eggs, lean beef, chicken, turkey, seafood, and non-fat dairy products.

### Phase Two: The Cruise phase
During this phase, which generally takes about 3 days per every pound you want to lose, you alternate pure protein days with pure protein and vegetables. A few starchy vegetables are off-limits due to carbohydrate content, but the allowed foods are plentiful and varied.

### Phase Three: The Consolidation phase
This phase is designed to last 5 days for every pound you lose in the previous two phases. This is a crucial and often ignored step in the weight loss process. This is when your weight is just looking for an opportunity to come back and join the pack! During this phase, certain foods (bread, fruit) and 2 "celebration" meals a week are added back into your diet.

### Phase Four: The Permanent Stabilization phase
This phase addresses long-term weight control and requires that you follow three rules for the rest of your life:

* 1 pure protein day every Thursday for the rest of your life
* No more elevators and escalators
* 3 tablespoons of oat bran a day (see below)

As with any high-protein diet, drinking large amounts of water is crucial. It is imperative that protein waste is flushed out of your system. Dr. Dukan recommends a minimum of a quart and a half each day.

Oat bran is essential to the diet and "the only carbohydrate allowed among the proteins." Rich in soluble fiber and protein, but containing a few simple sugars, oat bran can help you feel full, it can push food through your system more quickly, and it can reduce the absorption of dietary fat.

Let's not talk about weight loss without mentioning exercise. Dr. Dukan prescribes exercise, specifically walking, as essential.

## Diet Books For Weight Loss Inspiration!

Hundreds of diet books for weight loss exist that concern dieting and exercise. Many are even fun to read and easy to understand! The science behind losing weight doesn't seem to change much, does it? It's pretty much always been "calories in versus calories out."  

You may find that approaching weight loss from a different perspective helps provide that little extra incentive that you might need to get started. I've always enjoyed reading books and about the subjects of weight loss and health, often finding that information provides motivation for weight loss. I've included a few favorite diet best sellers that I've found to be particularly interesting. 

Your local library will have copies of most of the popular diet hardbacks. If you prefer to own your own, check out my Amazon store where I've selected my favorite weight loss products, including books, foods, kitchen products, etc.

If you prefer shorter versions of inspiration, reading weight loss articles can also be very motivating. Online sites such as Ezine, Goarticles, Amazines, American Chronicle, HubPages, Helium, Squidoo, etc. all offer a wide variety of health-related articles.

## Include Major Food Groups

Do you know what it means to "eat healthy?" Surveys show that most people consider themselves to be good eaters. If that is accurate, then why do we have such a serious epidemic of obesity? The answer, of course, is that many people don’t understand what it means. People often confuse the phrases “eat healthy” and “eat proper portions.” It’s universally accepted that __not__ eating too much at one time is one of the best things we can do for our health. __What you eat, however, is just as important, and perhaps more important, than how much you eat__. 

Eating healthy foods in the [proper portion sizes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-01-portion-control %}) can make huge improvements in your overall health. When you eat well on a regular basis, you will notice that you feel better, you have more energy and stamina, and you have more room in that favorite pair of jeans!  

And if that’s not enough to convince you to [make some changes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-12-change %}), you will also lower your risk of heart disease, certain cancers, type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. So, what does it mean to “eat healthy”? Are you ready to make the commitment but just don’t know where to begin? First of all, become familiar with the USDA or the Harvard School of Public Health food pyramids.  Both are great resources to help you make wise choices.

This food pyramid is from the Harvard School of Public Health and varies slightly from the revised USDA food pyramid. This will be a valuable tool in your quest for wellness.

## Know Your Food Groups:

* Protein—2-3 servings (meat, fish, poultry, beans, nuts)
* Whole Grains—6-11 servings (some breads, some pastas, brown rice, some cereals, etc.)
* Vegetables—3-5 servings (lettuce, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, spinach, etc.)
* Fruit—2-4 servings (apples, bananas, berries, pineapple, etc.)
* Dairy—2-3 servings (milk, yogurt, cheese)
* Oils—5-6 teaspoons (olive oil, salad dressings, butter, nuts, avocado, mayonnaise, etc.)

You’ll notice that the recommended number of servings varies quite a bit, especially within the category of whole grains. The number of servings you have should depend on your activity level and the total calories you eat each day.  

So, for example, if you exercise a minimum of 30 minutes a day, and eat 1,600 calories a day, you choose the lower number of servings. If you're very active and/or eat 2,800 calories a day, you choose the higher number of servings.

Are you ready to create exercise plans for weight loss but you’re just not sure how to get started? The really great news is that making the commitment to begin is the single most important factor! 

If you normally lead a sedentary life, then getting out of the house that very first day will be your biggest challenge. It's easy to justify why tomorrow would be a better day to begin. There's always going to be something you'd rather do or some inclement weather to blame it on.

* __Consider__ the [reasons why you want to become fit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-09-healthbenefits %}).
* __Make a list__ of the pros and cons if that will help you.   
* __Dig deep__ and find that self-discipline that will help you make the first move.  
* __Understand and follow__ these basic concepts and then create your own exercise plans for weight loss!

### How do I create a good exercise program? 
Good exercise plans for weight loss consist of the following:

* __Aerobic Training__--increases the function of the heart, lungs, and circulatory system. This would include activities such as [walking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-20-walking-for-weight-loss %}), jogging, [biking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-14-exercise-bike-for-weight-loss %}), [swimming laps]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-09-aquatic-exercise-for-weight-loss %}), stair climbing, jumping rope, and dancing.
* __Strength Training__--helps build and retain muscle. This would include lifting weights, both machines and free weights and other activities that require strength such as power yoga. 
* __Flexibility__--decreases risk of injury, increases blood supply to joints, and improves balance. This would include yoga, tai chi, Pilates, and any other activities involving stretching.

__How do I get started?__ The three elements of activity are:

* __Frequency__-- “How often?” 2-3 times per week for a beginner but work up to 5 times a week.
* __Intensity__--“How hard?” Let your body be the judge. Shoot for moderate intensity. Sweating is good!  Remember that you should be able to carry on a conversation when exercising aerobically.
* __Time__--“How long?” This can be in minutes or repetitions. Start small and gradually increase as you become stronger and more fit.

__NOTE:__ Frequency and time are more important than intensity! As Nike would say; 

> “JUST DO IT!”

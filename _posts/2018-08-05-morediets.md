__There are more diets to choose from than you can possibly imagine!__

The good news is that virtually all diets work! The bad news is that we get tired of them easily, and many of them aren't very good for us.

Typically, when a diet doesn't work, it's because of the dieter and not the diet. Sticking to a weight loss plan is easier said than done!

Our bodies are very resilient and if we're lucky they will take most anything that we throw at them. The older I get, however, the more aware I am of trying to treat my body well. After all, I'd like it to stay in good working order for years to come.

For that reason, even when I create short-term drastic diets, I try to make sure that the emphasis is on nutritionally dense food.

I did not create this next diet but I did go on it with my office-mates at work.  

When I first tried this diet, I expected it to be more challenging, but after the first day or two, it was surprisingly satisfying. The extra protein and the two snacks provided a sense of fulfillment that was unexpected.

### Breakfast
Protein shake with water OR 3 ounces of protein.

### Mid-Morning Snack
3 ounces of protein

### Lunch
6 ounces of protein with salad or green, non-starchy vegetable and one tablespoon of olive oil with vinegar.

### Mid Afternoon Snack
7 almonds.

### Dinner
3 ounces of protein with green, non-starchy vegetable.

### No Substitutions
NO SUGAR, STARCH, OR DAIRY!

TWO WEEKS ONLY!
As with all diets, and even exercise programs, it is so much easier if you have a "buddy." Studies show that motivation is easier to sustain if you diet with a partner, so try to find a spouse or good friend to join you on your weight loss journey!

I guess I'm lucky. I'm definitely a snacker, but for some reason, after dinner, I mentally check off food for the day.

Instead of substituting healthy food for snacks, I think you'd be better off in the long run if you tried to eliminate your after dinner snacking all together. 

Some things that might help are:

* Floss and brush your teeth for the night
* Chew sugarless gum
* Go upstairs and get away from the kitchen or just make the kitchen off-limits if you can't physically get away from it.
* Have a cup of hot tea
* Go for a short walk around the block
* Call a friend, read a book, work on the computer...
* Find something to do that will keep your fingers/hands busy such as knitting, cross-stitching, crafting, making jewelry, etc.

Good luck!

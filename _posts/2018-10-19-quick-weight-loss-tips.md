* Follow a diet plan - Such as the new (and free) [5-4-3-2-1 Diet Plan]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-31-5-4-3-2-1diet %}). You will see results within the first three days, try it and see! Follow it exactly as written however - that means no cheating! You won't be disappointed.

* Don’t graze! - Calories can easily and quickly add up fast! Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time and stick to the plan to avoid the temptation trap.

* Keep a chart - Or a food journal (check out our [printable weight loss journal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-07-printable-weight-loss-journal %})) so that you can track your progress to that special day. At the very least, marking the days down on your calendar, as visuals can be a very motivating tool to keep you going when times are hard.

* Amp up your workouts - Just for this short period of time try and add in an extra workout (our [cardio exercise for weight loss]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-08-cardio-exercise-for-weight-loss %}) guide will help you out) each day if you can. Even as little as 20 minutes extra will help hugely.

* Chew sugar-free gum - If you need something flavorful in your mouth, gum will help keep the cravings away and prevent you from sneaking that piece of candy!

* Limit your portions - To get the most out of you efforts. If you're not following the 5-4-3-2-1 Diet, never eat more than a frozen dinner-sized portion at a meal.  

* Try eating ONLY frozen dinners - But only for a short period of time. This may sound strange sure, but actually they're already set up for [portion-control]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-01-portion-control %}).

* Add a piece of fruit - To satisfy your sweet tooth and avoid the sugar!

* Cut out salt, sugar and flour - That's tough to do, but for this short period of time, use "lite" salt or some other artificial salt or alternative seasoning altogether. For a period of time to give you a head start avoid sugar and flour too for best results.

* Acupuncture - This may sound a pretty unusual way to lose weight but actually, it's been proven to be a very effective alternative practice for dieters. And it doesn't hurt either! Take a look at our [acupuncture and weight loss]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-13-acupuncture-and-weight-loss %}) for more info.

* Abstain from alcohol - For these few weeks. Instead wait and enjoy it on your big night or after that important milestone has passed.

* Drink plenty of water - Yes, you'll be running to the bathroom frequently, but it will also flush out your system and help get rid of excess fluids.

* And finally, NO recreational eating - Eat with intention! Do nothing else while you eat. Savor each bite and eat slowly - These small things are the difference between feeling satisfied and feeling deprived.

You don't have to adopt every one of these quick weight loss tips, some might simply not fit in with your work or home life, but by choosing a few and making them part of your daily life you can see begin to feel the benefits in only a few days.

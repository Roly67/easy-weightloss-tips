Know the fiber benefits!  It’s hard to imagine but until the 1970s, fiber was completely ignored as being beneficial to your health.  

Today, you can't pick up any health-related publication without reading how important fiber is to your overall well being.

Fiber is only found in plants and it is indigestible. That’s right…it passes through the human digestive system virtually unchanged! You might not want to dwell too much on that! Read on to discover more facts about fiber, why we need it, and how we can get more of it!

Fiber is a special carbohydrate, which can be divided into two categories: soluble and insoluble.

__Soluble fiber__ dissolves in water and can be found in oats, peas, beans, apples, and carrots. It lowers blood cholesterol and blood sugar levels.

__Insoluble fiber__ cannot be dissolved in water and can be found in whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, and many vegetables. It is an excellent laxative.

A good diet should consist of 25-38 grams of fiber each day. Most Americans get half of that recommended amount.   

Can you believe that Americans currently consume about 10% of the fiber that was consumed 100 years ago? To be fair, one major reason for this decline is the advancement in wheat processing technology. 

## Daily Fiber Recommendations

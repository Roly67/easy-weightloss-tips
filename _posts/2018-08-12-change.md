Are you ready for a change in your life? 

* Do you go to bed full and wake up feeling sluggish?
* Is your face puffy and swollen in the morning?
* Do you avoid mirrors?
* Do you wear your “sweats” as much as possible?
* Do you avoid social functions so that you don’t have to find something that fits or because you’re embarrassed for anyone to see you?   
* If you have to answer, “Yes” to these or similar questions, then you are probably ready to make some important life adjustments!

Is it going to be easy to make lasting changes in your life? No, it’s rarely easy to modify our habits, but it is “doable”, and the rewards are completely amazing!  

An important __first step__ to making significant changes in your life is to sit down and give some serious thought to what is going well for you in life and what is not. You’re probably used to avoiding this issue but it’s time to face it!  

Make yourself a list. The act of writing down your thoughts makes them very real. You’ll be much more likely to follow through with your plan if you write it down!

You’ll find when you make this list that there are going to be some things that you just can’t control. Don’t let that get you down. Focus on the things you can control! Everything starts with YOU, so focus on YOU!  

When you make changes in your health and appearance, and like what you see in the mirror, everything else will look differently to you too.  

The old adage about the “rose-colored glasses” is really true! So don’t worry about those items on your list that you can’t tackle right now—just tackle YOU!  

It doesn’t matter what else is going on in your life, no one controls what you put in your mouth except you. Forget the reasons why you can’t make it work and as Nike would say, “Just do it!”

Self-improvement provides almost instant gratification and that is very appealing to most of us!  

I was once large enough that I lost 30 pounds before anyone that didn’t know I was dieting, noticed the weight loss! How is that “instant” you might ask? Well, even though acquaintances may not have noticed, I was aware of the changes within the very first week.

Within three days I:

* Felt thinner inside which improved my self-esteem
* Slept better
* Felt stronger because I was tackling the problem
* Lost the puffiness around my eyes

Within two weeks I:

* Noticed my face getting thinner
* Noticed my rings slipping around my fingers
* Felt well enough to add exercise to my daily routine
* Began to feel the power that comes with sticking to a program
* Started feeling in control for the first time in a long time
* Noticed I was truly satisfied with less food 
* Noticed that my pants were more comfortable around the waist

You get the idea…the list gets longer and longer with each passing week!  

If you’re like I was and need to lose large amounts of weight, don’t despair! Never think in terms of, “I have to diet for a year to look good!” Instead, tell yourself that you are going to “diet today.” Each new day you’ll want to focus on that day only.  

Set small weight loss goals and celebrate each five pounds that you lose. You’ll find that the longer you stick to your plan, the stronger your [MOTIVATION]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-11-motivation %}) will become!

One of the most important pieces of weight loss advice I can give you is to take away the __time factor__. 

Too many people begin a program and establish a time line. That often sets you up for failure.  If you decide you want to lose 30 pounds in three months and you only lose 22, you’ll feel like you failed!  

But think about that! You lost 22 pounds!!  How incredible is that? Why should you feel anything but pure joy and a wonderful sense of accomplishment? Sure, you’re impatient to look great, but remind yourself that “FAST loss” isn’t the same as “FAT loss.” If it comes off slowly, there’s a greater chance that you will change your lifestyle and it will stay off!

If you are just too overwhelmed by the task ahead of you, select several small changes to transform your diet--which you know you can commit to.  

Decide that for this one week, you will eat three small meals a day and two snacks. In addition, you will be finished eating before 7pm. Next week, add another goal or two. You will do these same two items but in addition, you will have 3 ounces of lean protein at each meal and you will only have one diet soda each day. By the third week, you will add 30 minutes of walking or activity each day and drink eight glasses of water each day.

Anyone trying to lose weight knows how important it is to burn maximum calories! Activity equals weight loss so it's imperative to find ways to be more active! The excellent news is that everything we do burns calories! Your body even burns calories at rest. This is commonly called your [basal metabolic rate]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-11-basal-metabolic-rate %}). Take a look at the comparison between these common activities and the number of calories they burn, based on body weight!

## Working out on an empty stomach?
A 2011 report published in _Strength and Conditioning Journal_ reports that the body burns approximately the same amount of fat regardless of whether you eat before or after a workout. The report goes on to state, however, that without proper fuel for the workout, your body may lose muscle, and your calorie-burn will be diminished. This study directly contradicts the myth that exercising on an empty stomach burns more fat.

Weight loss shake recipes are as unlimited as your imagination, and an excellent source for vitamins, minerals, and healthy weight loss! They're a fantastic way to get fill up on low calorie, high nutrition sustenance without the worry about extra sugar and fats! Summer is an especially good time to drink these delicious, refreshing drinks because of the abundance of available fresh fruit, but I enjoy them all year, and you can do the same thanks to frozen fruit from your local store

Each weight loss shake recipe can be used as a healthy snack or as a meal replacement. If you drink the shake, or 'diet smoothie' (as they’re often called) in place of a meal, be sure to get adequate protein in your diet to stay balanced and healthy. Years ago, it was common to put raw egg whites in the shake for additional protein, but most people are quite hesitant to do that today. Instead, another option is to buy a low-calorie protein powder at your local health-food store and add a scoop to the blender when making your favorite shake.

Whey protein is fantastic for this and is also very affordable. Just be sure it is actually low-calorie, because some of those protein powders are designed to help people 'bulk up' by being calorie intensive. If you don’t use the protein powder, make sure that you make up for the protein at your other meals with food items such as beans, white meat or low fat dairy.

Use the basic weight loss recipe below and then get creative! It’s easy to get started. You’ll need a blender because there’s just no adequate substitute, but that’s the only piece of equipment you need to create your own healthy drinks! You might want to write down your different creations to be sure that you can reproduce your favorites when you're ready!

## Weight Loss Shake Recipe:
The great thing about the weight loss shake recipes below is that by simply switching out fruit you aren't keen on and replacing it with your favorite fruit flavors, you can create an almost unlimited range of fantastic tasting shakes to keep you on track for your weight loss goals. Blend with ice, the more you add, the thicker the shake! Each ingredient you add to the blender will change the taste. You can create your own weight loss smoothie by experimenting with different fruits.

* Try adding different combinations of watermelon, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, mango, coconut, etc. You can add other health ingredients too like carrot!
* Try adding a banana, one teaspoon of vanilla, and a heaping teaspoon of instant coffee!  
* Experiment by adding a couple of teaspoons of chocolate syrup or cocoa. 
* Try adding a tablespoon of peanut butter! Truly the possibilities are limitless!

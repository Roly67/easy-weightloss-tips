Hi, a plateau usually just tells us that our body is used to the new routine, both with diet and exercise. (Congrats on your weight loss, by the way!!) You need to change things up a bit. I would suggest that you do one of two extreme things. I would go temporarily on a "drastic diet" for one to two weeks max, such as this plan:

Go on the [5-4-3-2-1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-31-5-4-3-2-1diet %}) diet for just two weeks.

Follow it exactly and don't cheat! You pick the food but the diet helps you eat small amounts. Choose highly nutritious foods because that will be more satisfying and keep your metabolism strong.

Drink plenty of water to keep your system flushed and to help you feel full. Give up soda for the two weeks, even diet, and all other sweet drinks as well. Also, no alcohol for 2 weeks. Chew sugar-free gum between meals if you need a flavor in your mouth. 

Keep up your workouts but change them up a bit.

OR

I would do the exact opposite and not diet at all for a week. Don't go crazy but eat what you want in reasonable amounts. Either of these two things ought to jump-start your weight loss again. You'll want to change up your exercise too--do something different, do more, do less, do more intense, something...

In the meantime, read this page that has a good perspective on diet plateaus. It's about all the "Non-Scale Victories" you've accomplished.

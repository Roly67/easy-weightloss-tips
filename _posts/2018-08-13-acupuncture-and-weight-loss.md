## Acupuncture and Weight Loss: Think Outside the Box

Acupuncture and weight loss, as a partnership, is one of the more controversial issues in the “diet world."

Americans alone spend more than 33 billion dollars a year on weight loss programs, even though the failure rate remains incredibly high.  

Is it any wonder that people are looking for healthy alternatives that have no harmful side effects and no chance for addiction?

Acupuncture uses long, thin, stainless steel needles, which are inserted into over 2,000 pressure points in the body.  

While widely used in Korea and Japan, China is generally looked upon as the authority in this field. Acupuncture as a medical procedure began over 2,000 years ago, but it’s popularity in mainstream society is relatively new.

A 2002 National Health Review Survey stated that 8.2 million Americans reported using acupuncture treatments.

What about the relationship between acupuncture and weight loss? Does it work? Even the proponents of this procedure are quick to point out that in order to lose weight, you must burn more energy than you take in.   

They believe that an acupuncture diet is beneficial for losing weight because it increases the patient’s energy, making them want to exercise. It also lessens muscular pain, allowing the individual to continue with their workouts.   

Generally, it improves circulation, reduces stress, (and therefore cravings), and it increases metabolism. How can that be negative?  

An added bonus is that Chinese researchers reported that test subjects who tried to lose weight with acupuncture lost twice as much as patients that used diet alone.  

They further report decreases in cholesterol and triglycerides. 

One aspect of acupuncture and weight loss that has perhaps hurt the reputation of this procedure is the issue of ear stapling. 

This practice was devised in America and is considered ineffective and maybe even dangerous.  

With ear stapling, only two pressure points are used in the ear. Staples are left in the ear and sometimes become infected or dislodge themselves and fall into the ear canal.  

If you plan to even consider this procedure, make certain you are using a certified acupuncturist.

During acupuncture treatment most patients report feeling little or no discomfort. Some patients describe a warming sensation, a calming effect, or even a feeling of being “energized.” Obviously, the effects felt depend on the individual and the pressure points targeted.

So, are you ready to try it?  If so, follow these easy steps to help you be more successful:

* Check with your doctor first.
* Find a reputable, certified acupuncturist.
* Decrease you caloric intake.
* Increase your daily activity.
* Stay focused and positive.
* And finally, be patient!

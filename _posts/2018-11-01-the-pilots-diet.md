The Pilots Diet is about as retro as they come! This is a drastic diet, reminiscent of the 1980s, which delivers amazing results if you're willing to follow it to a "T". Veer off course even a little, and you've changed the outcome of it all! Developed around the theory of food combinations, the diet claims that it's the chemical reactions from food that are more important than calorie consumption. Don't get too excited yet though.. This is definitely a low-calorie diet! So let's talk about what this drastic diet can offer you and how it'll benefit your weight loss targets.

I can't even remember the last time I tried a diet that dictated EXACTLY what had to be eaten at each meal! Directions mandate that there can be no substitutions or modifications at all. This is why I'm calling this a 'drastic diet'. This means that if a "small salad" doesn't specify salad dressing, then there is NO salad dressing! If mistakes are made, the dieter must begin again at Day 1. It's a cruel to be kind approach to losing weight! The diet makes outrageous claims for potentially huge drops, but losses of 20-30 pounds in 28 days are not unusual, and in that respect, this is one diet that lives up to it's hype!

## The Pilots Diet Sample - Day 13:
The Pilots Diet puts an emphasis on [lean protein]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-06-high-protein-foods %}), but severely limits both carbohydrates and refined sugar. The first few days were not fun, especially if you're a volume-eater, but I found that around Day 3, it no longer mattered. In fact, the truth of it was that I marveled at how much better I felt without that constant feeling of fullness. Mentally, I was more content because the food worry was taken out of the equation. I discovered that I could be totally satisfied with much less than I was used to eating daily.

* B-½ orange or ½ grapefruit, 1-2 boiled eggs
* L-Grilled meat, tomato, one orange or grapefruit
* D-mixture of fresh fruit (orange, cantaloupe, plum, apples, watermelon)

## The Pilots Diet testimonials:
"It works! But most diets do if you can follow them. Knowing that there is an end helps you to follow this diet; unfortunately depriving yourself makes you want to have every thing you denied yourself. If you can exert self-control during and after this diet, and you only need to lose a few pounds then it is perfect. On the other hand if you have lots of weight to lose this diet is a great jump-start as long as you continue." - Jennifer Young, Spain

> "I lost 18 pounds in 28 days. It wasn't quite the 30 pounds advertised, but I didn't expect it to be. I can usually lose about 10 pounds on my own in the same time period, so I was pleased. I felt really good (physically) while I was on this diet."

> "In 28 days, I lost 13.5 pounds, and that was after being on a different diet for 5 months! This diet is absolutely a belly reduction diet! I have that Buddha belly shape; smaller legs, but rounded face and belly. By week 2 I noticed belly reduction & by week 3 there was a significant reduction in my neck fat as well. A huge plus on this diet for me, came in the way it affected some of my female-related health issues. THAT was the BEST part of this diet for ME!!

>“I attempted this diet after a friend of mine started to have remarkable results in a very short time. I was apprehensive at first, as I could not imagine losing twenty to thirty pounds in 28 days. The first week was the most difficult for me, as I had to adjust to eating very few calories. After the first week, I quickly got into the rhythm of the diet, and I began to see much quicker results than I had ever seen on any other diet, including Weight Watchers. I lost a total of 13 pounds in 28 days and was very pleased with the results. I recommend this to anyone who wants to “jump-start” a diet, but you have to be willing to follow the diet as it is written with no cheating.”

## Note from us..
Barbara mentioned above about The Pilots Diet being a "belly-buster" and I would have to absolutely agree with that. I saw faster results in my abdominal area on this diet than on any other I can remember! If [belly-fat]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-19-belly-fat %}) is your issue, this may be just the diet you've been looking for!

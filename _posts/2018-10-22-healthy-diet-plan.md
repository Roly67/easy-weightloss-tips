Are you looking for a healthy diet plan that will help you achieve your weight loss goals? If so, you're already ahead of 90% of other dieters looking to reach their weight loss goals! Having a plan is the first, and most important step you'll take. However, simply having a plan isn't good enough, it needs to be the RIGHT plan to suit YOUR goals. With so many choices out there, how do you find the best diet plan for you? There are several factors that you should consider when making this very important decision. Start by giving some serious thought to exactly what it is you hope to achieve.. and be specific!

Probably the most important factor when choosing a healthy diet plan is your timeline. Are you after long-term weight loss (a lifestyle change) or are you under a time constraint? If you need to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time, your weight loss options will change. If time isn’t a factor, more conventional diet plans work well. However, if you’re trying to lose the most weight in a short amount of time, then there are more drastic diets around. You can find a complete list of our [free weight loss diet plans]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-03-free-weight-loss-diet-plans %}).

Are you willing to deprive yourself temporarily of your favorite foods and beverages or would you be more successful being able to eat anything, just in smaller portions? If deprivation (for example, no alcohol for a period of time) works for you, would you need to (and are you willing to) make changes to your social life for the duration of your diet? Many diets recommend no alcohol, however some actually allow it as long as you do so in moderation and it fall within the rules of the diet program you're using. Some of the diet plans we provide for free allow a wide variety of foods, while others insist you avoid sugar for example.

Speaking of sweets, can you give them up for the duration of your diet? If you would like to lose weight without giving up your sweet tooth, you might want to look into the [Cookie Diet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-02-cookie-diet %}). This program requires you to eat special cookies for two meals each day. Seriously, it's true! The special cookies are tasty, filling and proven to work for weight loss.

Do you prepare most of your meals at home or do you prefer to eat in restaurants? The Pilot’s Diet, while quite effective as a short-term healthy diet plan, is a very difficult plan to follow if eating out. Others, such as the Mediterranean Diet and The Dukan Diet, are easy to follow even using restaurant menus, which helps your social life too!

Would you find it motivating to keep a food journal or are you the type of person that finds food tracking to be tedious and time-consuming? We should make it clear here that there's quite a bit of positive research indicating that food journaling improves your success!

Would you be willing to exercise, and if so, how often and at what level of intensity? It is certainly possible to lose weight successfully without activity, however the more calories you burn, the faster you will achieve your goal, and the better you will look once you get there. Do you prefer plans that allow you to eat whenever hungry or are you able to follow calorie-restrictive plans? Both [5-4-3-2-1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-31-5-4-3-2-1diet %}) and [The Pilot’s Diet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-01-the-pilots-diet %}) are very restrictive, however [The Dukan Diet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-02-the-dukan-diet %}) allows you to eat more as long as you eat specified foods.

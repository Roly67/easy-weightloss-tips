If you're hungry all the time it's because you either aren't eating enough or you're eating the wrong foods. 

Why don't you try keeping a food log for a week or two, which can help you analyze your current diet? You can print a free one here.

If you're trying to lose weight, the very least number of calories you should be eating is 1200 and even that's considered low. So, check to see how many calories you're currently eating and whether or not you’re getting in all the [food groups ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-18-eat-healthy %})

In addition to eating enough food, eating the right foods is just as important! Foods high in protein and fiber fill you up and keep you full the longest. So check your diet to see if you're getting enough of these nutrients. 

You should be eating a diet mainly of lean protein, veggies, fruit, whole-grains, low-fat dairy, and heart-healthy oils. 

You should be eating 3 small, healthy meals a day and 2 small, healthy snacks each day. Make each meal less than 400-500 calories and each snack less than 100-150 calories. Check to see how your diet compares.

Make water your main beverage and save all sweet drinks (even those with artificial sweeteners) for special occasions. 

Eliminate as much salt and sugar as you can from your diet. The salt makes you retain fluid and the sugar adds empty calories (without any nutritional benefit.)

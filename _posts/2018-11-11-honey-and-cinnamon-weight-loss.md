## [Raw Honey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-13-raw-honey %}) – sweet but not fattening
The key to the effectiveness of raw honey is the fact that it’s a sweetener – contains sugars – but isn’t fattening.  This is because raw honey has a low glycemic index number.

A glycemic index number measures how much a food affects the body’s blood sugar level.  A food with a low glycemic index level is slow to digest, while a food with a high glycemic index level is digested quickly – sending blood sugar levels soaring.

When blood sugar levels rise, the body releases insulin which promotes the storage of glucose as fat, which results in weight gain.  Thus, food with a low glycemic index number – such as [raw honey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-13-raw-honey %}), is less fattening then one with a high glycemic index – such as sugar.

The glycemic index of raw honey is about 55 while that of sugar is 61. 

Because of this, [raw honey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-13-raw-honey %}) also absorbs slower and lasts longer in the body, providing a steadier source of energy then a “sugar rush”.  Also, honey tastes sweeter than sugar so you get the same taste using less.

Like raw honey, cinnamon also has a regulatory effect on blood sugar.  It also causes a small, increase in metabolism.  

Cinnamon is a warming spice, it has thermogenic properties.  Thermogenesis temporarily elevates body temperature which can increase the metabolic rate.  While this metabolic increase is small – maybe only an additional 50 to 60 calories burnt – a steady, daily intake of cinnamon, combined with a good diet and exercise, will help achieve weight loss.

Studies have shown that, after taking in Ceylon cinnamon, there is a lowering of the level of insulin in the blood stream.  Lower levels of insulin mean less fat is formed.

I love soups!  

I typically just throw ingredients into a pot and have never been disappointed. Whatever you do, don't feel like you have to follow recipes exactly and don't be afraid to experiment!  

Armed with a box of fat-free, low-sodium vegetable, chicken, or beef broth, some garlic, onions, celery, and carrots, and a few fresh, canned, or frozen vegetables, you are ready!

You simply can't go wrong with a large pot of steaming, delicious, nourishing soup!

I hope you enjoy this selection of my favorite healthy recipes. If you have easy, low-calorie recipes you'd like to share, please contact me. I'm happy to give you credit!

## My Vegetable Soup
I fill a 5 Qt. pot with this soup and eat out of it the whole week. It is a delicious, filling, healthy meal!

Combine:

2 cans of petite-diced tomatoes 

1 can tomato puree or crushed tomatoes 

Bite-sized chunks of 2 zucchini, 2 yellow squash, 1 large onion, 2-3 stalks of celery, carrots, and 2 bell peppers. 

Add reduced-sodium chicken or vegetable broth to fill the pot  

Stir well with salt, pepper, garlic powder (or fresh) and season to taste. 

Simmer for an hour.

__NOTE:__

I don't know anything about seasoning but I always do the same thing and it always comes out tasting great. In a snack-sized baggie, I give a few shakes of dried oregano, thyme, basil, rosemary, and tarragon. I close the baggie and use a hammer to crush the seasoning. I then add it to the pot and stir well.

I've recently started adding diced jalapeno peppers and that adds a nice "bite."

## Split Pea or Lentil Soup
Wash well and then soak overnight a bag of split peas or lentils. 

Rinse again and add to pot with enough low-sodium, fat-free chicken or vegetable broth to barely cover.

Bring to a boil. 

Dice a large onion, 3 stalks of celery, several baby carrots, and 3-4 cloves of fresh garlic. Add and stir well. Peel, dice, and add a potato. (optional)

Add salt and pepper to taste. Some people enjoy ground ginger, cumin, or tarragon.

## Gazpacho

This is a delicious, healthy, low-calorie recipe that you just can't mess up. There are many variations. I prefer mine to be chunky and spicy, but I know some people who like theirs blended. This is a variation of a recipe that my friend, Marian, gave me years ago. I usually make a large pot and eat it for a week.

Dice the following vegetables into a large bowl or pot:

* 2 large cucumbers, peeled and seeded 
* 2 bell peppers, seeded
* 2 onions
* 3-4 stalks of celery
* 2-3 handfuls of baby carrots
* 3-4 tomatoes
* Add about 4 cups of tomato juice, to desired thickness. You could add some broth too. 
* Add 3-4 cloves of minced or pressed garlic, a few dashes of Tobasco sauce, and salt and pepper. 
* Stir in 1/3-1/2 cup red wine vinegar (to taste) and 1 T. olive oil.
* My friend, Pat, also add 2 T. lemon juice. 

Stir well and let sit in the refrigerator for at least two hours. The longer it sits, the better it gets.

__NOTE:__ If you like yours blended, either use a hand blender in the bowl or pot, or pour half into a blender to puree, before adding it back to the pot.

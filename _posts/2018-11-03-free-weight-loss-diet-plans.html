                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-01-the-pilots-diet %}" >The Pilots Diet</a>
                    - This retro diet is based on the chemical reactions in food, and can
                    blast belly-fat faster than anything I've experienced! Designed to last
                    only 28 days, losses of 20-40 pounds have been reported by some
                    dieters.</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-29-cleansing-detox-diets %}" >Cleansing Detox Diets</a>
                    - These diets are the entire craze now. They're very similar to what we
                    used to call "fasting." You'll see results but once you start eating
                    again, the weight will come back on quickly. </p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-02-the-dukan-diet %}" >The Dukan Diet</a>
                    - This "French diet", designed by Dr. Dukan, is essentially a
                    high-protein, low-sugar/carb diet that is extremely effective and easy
                    to follow. It has four specific phases, which will take you from rapid
                    weight loss to life-long maintenance.</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-30-anti-aging-diet %}" >The Anti-Aging Diet</a>
                    - As we age, we all want to continue to look and feel as fabulous as we
                    possibly can. This diet will enable individuals of all ages to remain
                    vital, active, and strong! It's never too early to start taking care of
                    yourself!</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-22-morediets-2 %}" >Three-Day Protein Diet</a>
                    - I don't know who created this diet but it's severe. The food is good
                    though so it's fairly easy to follow for the recommended amount of
                    time.</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-20-meal-ideas-for-mediterranean-diet %}" >The Mediterranean Diet</a>
                    - Experts all agree that this is the healthiest way to eat, hands down!
                    With an emphasis on lean protein, whole grains, olive oil, vegetables,
                    and fruits, there's nothing not to love about this diet!</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-06-high-protein-foods %}" >High Protein Foods Plan</a>

                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-19-freshman-15 %}">Freshman 15 Diet</a>
                    - The 'Freshman 15' is the term given to the 15+ pounds that many new
                    college students gain when they move away from home and start living the
                    'dorm life'. This diet is specifically designed to prevent the unwanted
                    weight gain for students! </p>

                    I designed this very effective diet after observing a friend who had
                    undergone gastric bypass surgery. I knew there had to be a way to get
                    similar results without going under the knife!</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-17-the-dash-diet %}">The DASH Diet</a> - The DASH Diet, which stands for <i>Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension</i>
                    was originally designed to help people lower their blood pressure and
                    cholesterol without medication. This diet has been receiving a lot of
                    buzz and is a wonderful lifestyle plan for anyone interested in
                    achieving maximum wellness!</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-08-paleo-diet-foods %}">The Paleo Diet</a>
                    - This high-protein diet, sometimes called The Caveman Diet, encourages
                    a diet similar to our ancestors who were hunters and gatherers.</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-22-morediets-2 %}">No Flour/No Sugar Diet</a>
                    - This is one of the rare free weight loss plans actually created by a
                    medical professional. Dr. Gott has written several books if you want
                    more information. The plan is easy to follow and works especially well
                    if you only have a small amount of weight to lose.</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-23-heart-healthy-diet %}">Heart Healthy Diet</a> - Whether you are trying to cope with or prevent heart disease, making
                    changes to the way you currently eat is a huge step in the right
                    direction. &#xa0;Following a heart healthy diet can improve your blood
                    pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-16-diet-for-runners %}">Diet for Runners</a>
                    - Runners often want to take off unwanted pounds too. Find out how
                    dieting for runners may be a littler different (and a little easier)
                    than dieting for the rest of us.</p>
                <p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-02-cookie-diet %}">The Cookie Diet</a> - The cookie diet is based on high protein and low carbohydrates and is
                    one of the simplest diets to follow. (And we've tested a bunch!) What is
                    great about the Cookie Diet is that there are very few
                    choices to make for the dieter!</p>

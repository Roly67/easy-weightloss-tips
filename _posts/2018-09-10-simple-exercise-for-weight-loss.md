Are you looking for the one simple exercise for weight loss that will help you meet your fitness goals?  

Do you need to start a program but you’re just not sure how to begin?  

There is a lot to consider when you have to make a choice as important as this one. Let’s look at some easy ways to get started.

### A good workout program consists of the following:
* Aerobic Training which improves your heart, lungs, and circulatory system,
* Strength Training which helps build and retain muscle, and
* Flexibility which improves balance, decreases risk of injury, and increases blood supply.

	<h4>Working out on an empty stomach?</h4>
	<p>A 2011 report published in&nbsp;<em>Strength and Conditioning Journal</em>&nbsp;reports that the body burns approximately the same amount of fat regardless of whether you eat before or after a workout. &nbsp;The report goes on to state, however, that without proper fuel for the workout, your body may lose muscle, and your calorie-burn will be diminished. &nbsp;This study directly contradicts the myth that exercising on an empty stomach burns more fat.</p>

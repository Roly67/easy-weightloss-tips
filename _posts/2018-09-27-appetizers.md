I just love healthy appetizers! I often like to make a meal of them. When I'm planning to entertain, I have the hardest time thinking of low-calorie, delicious, healthy hors d' oeuvres to serve to my guests.

It's so easy to grab the chips and salsa or the block of cheese. Now I keep this list taped inside my kitchen cupboard so that I can quickly and easily make choices. 

### Healthy Party Options:
* Roasted Garlic 
* Shrimp and cocktail sauce
* Oysters wrapped in bacon, served with mustard 
* Veggies and dip
* Edamame sprinkled with sea salt
* Fruit with a dip of fat-free whipped topping
* Relish tray
* Bruschetta 
* Smoked salmon served with crackers, fat-free cream cheese, capers, raw, red onions rings, and lemon wedges
* Cherry tomatoes and cubes of mozzarella cheese speared on a toothpick. Drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar
* Portobello mushrooms with cheese and spaghetti sauce
* Turkey kielbasa hunks on toothpicks, served with mustard

#### Baked Portobello Caps
My friend and neighbor, Pat, shared this low-calorie recipe with me a few years ago. It was so easy and delicious that I knew right away it was a "keeper." I made a few changes in the original recipe to make it more to my taste.

* Oven-375 degrees
* Spray a baking dish or cookie sheet with Pam
* Arrange the mushroom caps on the pan, gill side up
* Spread 1-2 T. of spaghetti sauce in each cavity
* Top with a small amount of goat, feta, or mozzarella cheese
* Bake for 20 minutes
* Garnish with chopped fresh basil (optional)

#### Oysters Wrapped in Bacon
* Preheat oven on broil
* Drain 1 pint of select oysters
* Using reduced-fat or turkey bacon, cut each strip into thirds
* Wrap each oyster in a piece of bacon and secure with a wooden toothpick
* Place oysters on broiling pan, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic powder
* Spread a small amount of mustard on each oyster
* Broil about four inches from the heat for 2-3 minutes, or until golden

#### Cowboy Caviar
My friend, Marian, gave me this popular appetizer recipe. It is always a big hit at her house. You don't have to be picky about what type of beans or tomatoes you use, as it is always delicious!

* 1 can black-eyed peas (or black beans)
* 1 can white corn
* 1 can chick peas (garbanzo beans)
* 2/3 cup green onion slices
* 1/2 lb. Roma tomatoes, chopped
* 1 ripe avocado, diced (optional)

Mix together with 2 T. red wine vinegar, 2 t. hot sauce, 2 t. olive or canola oil, salt and pepper.  Serve with low-fat tortilla chips.

#### Garbanzo Spread
In a food processor, add:

* 2 cans of drained garbanzo beans (chick peas)
* 3 cloves of garlic 
* 5-6 roasted red peppers (purchased in a jar) 
* The juice of 1 lemon or fresh rosemary (opt.)

Blend and drizzle olive oil in until smooth (about 3-4 T.)

Serve with veggies, low-fat crackers or low-fat pita chips

#### No-Guilt Guacamole
This appetizer is a big hit with my husband. He has no idea that peas are included in the ingredients.
(Makes about 1 1/2 cups.  Serving size=2T. For 55 calories, 3 g. fat, 1 g. fiber)

* 1 avocado
* 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
* 1 T. lime juice
* 1 medium tomato, diced
* 1/4 cup onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
* 1/2 t. ground cumin
* 1-2 T. fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (optional)

Scoop the avocado flesh into a bowl. Add the peas, lime juice, tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro, jalapeno, and cumin. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Blend or process until smooth or desired consistency.
